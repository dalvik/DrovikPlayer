     IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ANYONE MODIFYING THIS FILE
     READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES

     This file defines the binary compatibility for resources.  As such,
     you must be very careful when making changes here, or you will
     completely break backwards compatibility with old applications.

     To avoid breaking compatibility, all new resources must be placed
     at the end of the list of resources of the same type.  Placing a resource
     in the middle of type will cause all following resources to be
     assigned new resource numbers, breaking compatibility.
